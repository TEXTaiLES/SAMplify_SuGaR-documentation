# SuGaR: Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering

SuGaR (Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering) is a method used for the segmentation, annotation, and reconstruction of 3D point clouds and meshes. In this project, SuGaR is employed to process the point cloud generated by COLMAP, enabling efficient and accurate surface annotation and mesh reconstruction.
